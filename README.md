Scripts to Generate Dash Docsets
================================

This is a collection of scripts to download and index various
documentation to [Dash][1] docset format. Results have been tested to
work with Emacs and [helm-dash][2], but will probably work with all
applications that support the docset format.

To generate these docsets, you'll need `tar`, `wget`, Python 3, and
[Beautiful Soup 4][3].
